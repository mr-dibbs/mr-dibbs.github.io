Hey Everyone! I'm Chris - thanks for taking time to check out my blog! I'm a backend developer interested in learning frontend and I used the awesome blog-starter template (linked in footer) to start learning nextjs and vercel! I'll use this blog to post code and tech how-to's, and there will likely be random posts about things I like (my wife, dogs, balisongs, and fixing/tearing-everything-apart).

## That's all for now.

Come back soon for updates!
