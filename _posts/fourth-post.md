Today is going to be a low effort post (sorry, not sorry). This is a balisong flipping trick called the twirl.
I am a total noob, so be nice!

Biggest underestimate for me this year so far!! Turns out getting video on a page using markdown is tricky, but there are some hacks we can employ. I also learned that github has built in support for video on markdown files in the web ui. I'll document this exercise in an upcoming post. Basically, you have tell your markdown processor to use embedded html in the markdown file. This can be dangerous if you don't trust the content/author (I do, so I'm doing it)! If video is a big part of your use case, I'd look at other options than a markdown processor.
